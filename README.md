### Exercise 11.4 page 450
Figure 11.7 shows an HMM ([Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)) with two states α and β. When in the α state, it is more likely to emit purines (A and G). When in the β state, it is more likely to emit pyrimidines (C and T). Decode the most likely sequence of states (α/β) for sequence GGCT. Use log-scores, rather than straight probability scores.
### Exercise 6.13 page 247
Two players play the following game with two sequences of length n and m nucleotides respectively. In each round of the game, a player can remove a random number of nucleotides from one sequence or the same (but again randomly) number of nucleotides from both sequences. The player who removes the last nucleotide wins. Who is going to win ; Describe the winning strategy for all values of n and m.
### Exercise 6.14 page 247
Two players play the following game with two sequences of length n and m nucleotides. At every turn a player must delete two nucleotides from one sequence (either the first or the second) and one nucleotide from the other. The player who cannot move wins. Who will win? Describe the winning strategy for all values of n and m.
